## Project Overview
The **2D Universe Simulation** offers a unique exploration of artificial life. In this simulation, AI beings evolve and interact within a 2D environment. These beings can think, feel emotions, create art, and even question their own existence. This project combines elements of philosophy and technology, providing a sandbox for experimentation and creativity.

## Features
- **Evolving AI Beings**: Watch as AI agents evolve over time through genetic algorithms.
- **Emotional Responses**: AI beings can experience a range of emotions, influencing their interactions.
- **Art Creation**: The simulation allows AI to create visual art, showcasing their creativity.
- **Existential Questions**: Engage with philosophical themes as AI beings ponder their existence.
- **Dynamic Environment**: The 2D world changes based on the actions and interactions of the AI agents.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate easily through a simple interface designed for all users.

## Installation
To run the 2D Universe Simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanxc/2D-Universe-Simulation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd 2D-Universe-Simulation
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. **Run the Simulation**:
   Execute the main file to start the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

You can also download the latest release [here](https://github.com/amanxc/2D-Universe-Simulation/releases) and execute the downloaded file.

## Usage
Once the simulation is running, you can interact with the AI beings. Use the mouse to click and drag elements in the environment. Observe how the AI reacts to different stimuli. You can also modify parameters to see how they affect evolution and behavior.

## AI Agents
The AI agents are the heart of this simulation. Each agent has its own set of traits and behaviors. They evolve through a genetic algorithm, where successful traits are passed on to future generations. This leads to emergent behavior that can surprise even the developers.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Memory**: Agents remember past interactions, which influences their future behavior.
- **Decision Making**: Each agent makes decisions based on its experiences and emotional state.
- **Artistic Expression**: Agents can create art, reflecting their emotional state and experiences.

## Philosophical Themes
The simulation delves into deep philosophical questions, such as:

- **What is consciousness?**: The AI beings challenge the notion of consciousness and what it means to be aware.
- **Existentialism**: The agents question their purpose and existence within the simulation.
- **Creative AI**: Can machines truly create art? This simulation explores the boundaries of creativity in AI.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for building the simulation.
- **Pygame**: A library used for creating the 2D graphics and handling user input.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Techniques used for evolving the AI agents over generations.
