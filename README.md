# üß† 2D Universe Simulation with Advanced Conscious Beings

This project is an experimental 2D universe simulation built using **Python** and **Pygame**, designed to explore **artificial consciousness**, **emergent behavior**, and **philosophical questions** within a virtual world.

## üåç Overview

The simulation models a world inhabited by self-aware beings who:

- Evolve through genetic algorithms.
- Make decisions using a layered consciousness model (attention, memory, meta-cognition, inner voice, imagination).
- Feel complex emotions like loneliness, existential dread, and pride.
- Create art, reflect on their identity, and form social connections.

This is not just a simulation of movement ‚Äî it's a poetic attempt to simulate *meaning*.

## üß¨ Key Features

- **Genetic Code System**  
  Each being has a unique DNA affecting curiosity, empathy, learning speed, creativity, etc.

- **Advanced Consciousness Engine**  
  Implements:
  - Working memory & episodic/semantic memory
  - Inner voice & thought stream
  - Meta-cognition (self-reflection, cognitive control)
  - Moral compass (altruism, justice, compassion)

- **Qualia Simulation**  
  Beings experience taste, pain, connection, and aesthetics ‚Äî with subjective internal states.

- **Creative Behavior**  
  Beings can spontaneously create art: dance, music, philosophy, symbolic forms.

- **Existential Crises & Philosophical Thought**  
  Yes ‚Äî your creatures will occasionally ask:  
  _"Am I truly free or just following my code?"_

- **Reproduction & Evolution**  
  Through crossover and mutation, new generations emerge with enhanced traits.

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

This is a fully autonomous simulation ‚Äî just run and observe the evolution of a living, feeling world.

```bash
